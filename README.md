# Notes_and_exercises_on_Data_Structuring

Some Jupyter notebooks developed while stuiding Data Struturing and Categorical Encoding

## Contents

* **Merge:** Demonstrates how to combine DataFrames based on common columns using different merge strategies (inner, left, right, outer).
* **Concat:** Illustrates how to stack DataFrames vertically or horizontally using `pd.concat`. It covers concatenating along different axes and handling index alignment.
* **Join:** Explains how to combine DataFrames based on their indexes using `.join`. It highlights the focus on index-based merging and options for handling overlapping columns.
* **Groupby:** Demonstrates how to use the `groupby` method in Pandas to group data and calculate aggregates.
* **Pivot Tables:** Illustrates how to use pivot tables to reshape data for analysis and create summarized views.


## Libraries Used
