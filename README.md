# Notes_and_exercises_on_Data_Structuring

Some Jupyter notebooks developed during the study of the merge, concat, join, groupby, and pivot_table functions.


## Contents

* **Merge:** Demonstrates how to combine DataFrames based on common columns using different merge strategies (inner, left, right, outer).
* **Concat:** Illustrates how to stack DataFrames vertically or horizontally using `pd.concat`. It covers concatenating along different axes and handling index alignment.
* **Join:** Explains how to combine DataFrames based on their indexes using `.join`. It highlights the focus on index-based merging and options for handling overlapping columns.
